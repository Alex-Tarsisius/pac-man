# pac-man
Vanilla javaScript Game with HTML and CSS

A super simple walkthourgh to coding Pac-Man in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. View [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw) 

I have kept the styling super simple for you to take and make your own. Please do credit me if so :).

In this game I show you how to make Pac-Man move around the grid while avoiding walls, show you how to use the constructor method for all four ghosts to apply their unque characterisitcs to each one, including at what speed they move at. Clyde obviously being the slowest.

### Inbuilt JavaScript functions I have used: 
• addEventListener()
• getElementById()
• querySelector()
• for Loop
• appendChild()
• createElement()
• push()
• if else statements
• classList
• switch case
• keyCode
• forEach()
• setTimeout
• Class
• constructor
• setInterval()
• removeEventListener

### Next steps:
My next goal is to make a copy of this game and apply logic to the ghost moves to make them move closer and closer to Pac-man. At the moment they are choosing a direction to go in at random. I want to apply logic that makes them move closer to wherever Pac-man is.

Watch this space.
